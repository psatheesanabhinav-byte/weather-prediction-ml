* Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain or not using historical weather data and a machine learning model.

* Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a simple and interpretable classification model that predicts rain based on key weather features such as:
- Precipitation
- Maximum temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Wind speed

A Logistic Regression model is used for prediction due to its simplicity and interpretability.

* Dataset
- Source: Seattle Weather Dataset
- Format: CSV
- The target variable `rain` is created based on precipitation values.

* Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

* Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
5. Model training using Logistic Regression
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
7. Saving the trained model and scaler

* Results
The model successfully predicts rainfall with good accuracy and provides interpretable feature coefficients.

* About Me
I am a B.Sc. Mathematics graduate with a strong interest in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
I enjoy applying mathematical and statistical concepts to real-world problems using programming and machine learning techniques.

This project is part of my academic and practical preparation for pursuing higher studies in Data Science / AI.
